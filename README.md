<h1> Z-Fighter Run </h1>

<h2>2-D Platformer game created with Java and JFX using threading library.</h2>
<p> This was my first big project that I have ever built and allowed me to find my passion for programming. This project caused a lot of headache, confusion and in the end a great deal of satisfaction when things came together. This project allowed me to understand how useful and interface can be when programming with java, and the various ways that you can manipulate and create objects to carry out certain functions. As this was my first project it is riddled with many bugs and there are definately better optimization for it but it was a great entry way into breaking the coding barrier and understanding the fundamentals of computer science. </p>
